# Deep-Learning_Animal-Classification

This project implements an image classification model using TensorFlow's EfficientNetB3 architecture to classify animal images into various categories. The `.ipynb` includes data preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results using bar charts.

The goal of this project is to classify images of animals into predefined categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow. The EfficientNetB3 model was used for this purpose which requires a 224x224 input shape.
